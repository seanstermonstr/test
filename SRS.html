		<h2>2.0 General Description</h2>
		<p><strong>2.1 Procuct Perspective</strong></p>
		<p>Eagle Day is a multimedia application that replicates the historical simulation board game, “Eagle Day: The Battle For Britain” designed by Decision Games. Eagle Day provides a means of playing Eagle Day: The Battle For Britain. It allows two players to play against each other via network or locally on the same computer. Eagle Day also allows a single player to play against a computer.</p>
		<p>A rudementary representation of this is as follows.</p>
		<!-- Jimmy or Micah please resize this image to something that looks more preportional. Do not do it in the html/css itself, but change the actual image.-->

		<p><strong>2.2... <!-- add title to this section --></strong></p>
		<p>The following traceability matrix describes all the requirements placed on the development team by the client. The client requirements described below was listed in the problem description for a system modeling tool. The client requirements act as a contract between the client and the development team, ensuring that Eagle Day meet the expectations of the client. In addition to the client requirements, several requirements have been derived from the list of client requirements. Every requirement described in this section shall be described later in this document at the locations specified in the reference column. </p>
